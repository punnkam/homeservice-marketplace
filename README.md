# Marketplace for Home-Service contractors. 

### What

A home service marketplace application where businesess can showcase their business and interact with customers. Customers (homeowners) can browse and comment on businesses however they'd like. 

Used the React, Redux, Express, MongoDB stack and implemented login using JWT.

### Why?

Back home there are limited ways to find home service contractors for various home repair/development jobs. We rely primarily on word of mouth and cannot find someone to hire on short notice. This application is built to help match homeowners and home service businesses in a forum-esque website.
